# Intro
This is the initial draft for the scoring methodology. In its current state it only serves as a piece of the automation process to show at the user interface the interest rate based on the user's credit score.
On a second iteration, this document will provide a methodology based on best practices within the industry and the reforms that token engineers, ReFi advocates, and financial justice experts build together.

As a note, take in consideration that current interest rates in MÃ©xico vary between 60% to 365% a year, and do not provide any additional benefit to the borrower than the opportunity to access credit.
The intention of this protocol is to attract international DeFi lenders while channeling a sufficient profit amount to save up a non-withdrawable collateral for each borrower, as well as to make the protocol both operationable and scalable.
The ultimate goal is to facilitate the building of financial resilience by micro-business owners and get them access to the cheapest interest rates from their national level.
